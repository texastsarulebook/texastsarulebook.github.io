# Filings Protests

Follow the procedure below that applies to your scenario for filing a protest.

## Unique to Texas Onsite and Projects Protest Process

In order to file a protest in the Unique to Texas Events, advisors need to follow this procedure:

- Advisors can print the protest form at the Information/Help Desk in the Competition Hall.  Advisors only (No students) can request and complete the protest form.
- Once filled out, the advisor can return it to the information desk so it can be given to the UTE Manager.
- The UTE Manager reviews the protest to determine that it has met all the requirements for a protest.
- Protest must be based on specific rules and procedures.  They cannot be submitted to protest a judge's decision alone. For example, a protest can be filed for a team getting 45 seconds instead of the required 60 seconds. Or a project was deducted for missing a component but it was in fact present at the time of judging.
- Once the UTE Manager has determined that a protest is indeed warranted, the protest committee will review the protest and take action as necessary.

## National Qualifying Events Protest Process

In the event that something occurs during a National Qualifying Event and a protest needs to be filed this is the procedure:

- Advisors can print the protest form at the Information/Help Desk in the Competition Hall.  Advisors only (No students) can request and complete the protest form.
- Once filled out, the advisor can return it to the NQE desk.
- The NQE Manager reviews the protest to determine that it has met all the requirements for a protest. They will determine if action needs to be taken.
- Protest must be filed while the event is underway to ensure the best outcome.
 
If the protest concerns a modification made with the official permission of the NQE Managers and impacted all contestants equally then the protest will more than likely not result in any changes."
