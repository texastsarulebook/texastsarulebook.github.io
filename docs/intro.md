# Texas TSA Rulebook Introduction

The cost of transporting and insuring the projects to and from the competition is the responsibility of the school, advisors, and student. Texas TSA will not be responsible for damage, loss, or theft before, during, or after the competition. Texas TSA will not be responsible for mailing or shipping of any projects or awards. Chapters will be solely responsible for picking up projects and awards at the end of the State Contest.
