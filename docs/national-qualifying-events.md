# National Qualifying Events

:::info Important
National Qualifying Events (NQE) are events that can be competed at the regional, state and national level.  The Competitive Events Guide can be downloaded from the Total TSA dashboard once your chapter has finalized registration with National TSA. These rules and requirements may be modified at the state and regional levels. Details what NQE events are offered and how they are managed at the Texas state conference are below.

**Attendance at the State Conference is required of any students competing in this category.**

**Important:** Ignorance of the rules and/or misunderstanding of the rules as run at the State Conference is not an excuse for a protest or additional consideration.
:::

## Rules Modifications

Due to time limits and other extenuating circumstances, Texas TSA reserves the rights to make modifications on how it conducts National Qualifying Events (NQEs) at Texas TSA State Contest. Individual event coordinators must have any such modifications approved by the NQE Managers at state contest. These may include the following:

1. Shortening the contest time or interview time allowed
2. Only having 1 round for public performance style events
3. Limiting the number of teams interviewed in the final round

Rule modifications should be procedural only and not affect the intent of the competition rules.

## General Guidelines

### Dress Code Policy

Nationals Dress Code will be enforced in all NQE events.

Dress code is as follows:

- Official TSA Blue competition shirt, gray pants, black socks and black shoes
- Females may opt to wear skirts with or without hosiery in lieu of pants and socks
- Chapter Team must wear official TSA blazers, with patch, and the red TSA tie (males). Per National TSA, females will not be penalized for wearing the tie, but it is optional for them.

If you are unsure of the wording of a rule, have a question, or need clarification, please check the Texas TSA Event Modifications List. If it is not answered there, please email the NQE Managers at [nqe@texastsa.org](mailto:nqe@texastsa.org)

Although Texas TSA allows multiple entries to advance from regions even in events that are listed as "one per chapter" in the National Competitive Events Guide, National TSA will adhere to the entry limits posted. For example, although your chapter could bring 3 Architectural Design projects to Texas TSA State Contest, only one of those will be able to be entered by your chapter at Nationals. Please ensure that your members understand this to avoid any disappointment. If you have any questions, reach out to nqe@texastsa.org, but be on notice that we cannot override ANY chapter limits imposed by TSA Nationals.
