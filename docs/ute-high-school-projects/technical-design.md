# Section 3 - Technical Design

These events are designed for students using traditional drafting and computer aided design techniques to create industry documents. All projects must include the required documentation. Be sure to pay attention to the section guidelines for submission instructions as some events are submitted virtually before the conference and some must be physically present at the conference to be judged. Entries that have multiple sheets MUST be bound on the left side of the sheets using staples. Unbound sets or sets bound with temporary methods such as paperclips will not be accepted. Maximum sheet size is Arch D (24"x36").

Title blocks may contain only the following information:

- Student Initials
- Unique Student ID Number
- Category Number
- Title
- Description
- Scale

School logos are not allowed. Students may create their own logo to be used in the title block as long as it does not have any identifying information or reference to the school name.
