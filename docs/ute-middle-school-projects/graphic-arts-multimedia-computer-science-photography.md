# Section 2 - Graphic Arts, Multimedia, Computer Science and Photography

These events are designed for students using technology to produce graphics, photos, and programs to be used in a variety of ways. All projects must include the required documentation. Be sure to pay attention to the section guidelines for submission instructions as some events are submitted virtually before the conference and some must be physically present at the conference to be judged.

## Section 2.0 - Graphic Design

Items in this section involve student created projects in which students used design elements (such as typography and images) to convey information or create an effect. Projects are limited to 8 1/2" x 11" unless otherwise stated in the category details.

It is recommended that projects are placed in a clear front portfolio cover with the project and documentation. For projects such a t-shirt, place the project and documentation in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.

Definitions:

- Bound – the work or skill of fastening loose pages together inside a cover. Examples: spiral bound, glued and tape, GBC Machine
- Saddle Stitch – a stitch made by placing the center of the fold across the saddle of the stitcher and driving wire staples through and clinching them on the inside. Examples: Magazine or pamphlet
