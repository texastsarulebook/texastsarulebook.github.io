## Section 1.0 - CNC/CAM and 3D Printing

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) or Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) devices are used by students to create project entries in this section. Any projects in which CNC mills, lathes, routers, laser engravers, or similar devices were not used to produce all major components should not be entered in this category. Students are responsible for the design, material selection, and any assembly necessary to complete the project. Components such as hardware can be purchased but must be included in the documentation form.
