The Research Racer Competition CO2 Cars are cars used as miniature racing cars which are propelled by a carbon dioxide cartridge, pierced to start the release of the gas, and which race on a typically 60 feet (18 metres) track. They are frequently used to demonstrate mechanical principles such as mass, force, acceleration, and aerodynamics. They are formed by shaping a single piece of wood or plastic into the body of the car.
