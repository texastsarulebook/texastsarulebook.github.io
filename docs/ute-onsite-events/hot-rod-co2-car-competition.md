Hot Rod Competition (HRC) provides technology students with another opportunity to use their knowledge and skills in problem solving and the fun and excitement of racing competition. The goal of HRC is to encourage students to design and build realistic looking one-fourth mile hot rod car models. The project has been carefully planned to allow students to create realistic scale models of dragsters, funny cars, pro-stock cars and trucks and still have a chance to win races. The vehicle should be built of several parts or sub-assemblies rather than carved out or 3D printed as a single unit.
