Competitors will build their own Electric RC car either from their own design or from a kit. No store bought, already assembled RC cars will be permitted. The course will be a road race. The purpose of the RC race is to showcase the learning activities of students building radio-controlled cars and the components that make up this type of transportation system. All RC Vehicles must be electric/battery powered.
